To address the problem of finding which of the conversations are linked to the source in a given pipeline system, we have to apply breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the source. The procedure to perform this is as follows:

-Input Parsing: Open the file and note the two-dimensional grid representation's objects (sinks, sources, etc.) positions.

-Data Succession Initialization: Indicate a list of a collection (queue) for BFS and a set as a checklist of the places already visited.

-Apply BFS: Begin from the source then navigate through all reachable cells, noting connections between sinks and cells seen during the BFS.

-Get the Output: Get all the connections between sinks and cells seen during the BFS.


pseudocode=

1 Start by opening the file and constructing the grid with the objects that are given on the grid.

2 Don't forget to identify the source cell (by *) and add it to the BFS queue

3 Form the set of sinks that will be checked for connections.

4 Perform BFS:Per each cell, explore all possible linked neighbors by the kind of tube it's characterized.If a neighbor is a sink, add it to the set of connected sinks.

5 For each cell, consistently examine all of its possible connected neighbors based on the pipe type.

6 Add a neighbor to the set if it is a sink.

7 Provide the connected sinks in the list of sorted results.
